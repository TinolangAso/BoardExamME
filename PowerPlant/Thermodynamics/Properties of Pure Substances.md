pure substance - a substance that has a fixed chemical composition and 
homogeneous throughout

A mixture of various chemical elements or compounds also qualifies as
pure substance as long as the mixture is homogeneous. It may exist in more 
than one phase so long as its chemical composition is the same in all phases.

Compressed Liquid and Saturated Liquid

Consider a piston-cylinder device in isobaric process containing liquid water at
![[Pasted image 20240923103448.png]] 
$20^{\circ}C$ and $1\, atm$ pressure. Water then exists in a compressed liquid or subcooled
liquid. Meaning that it is not "it is not about to be vaporized". As more heat
increases, specific volume and temperature of the system(water) increases until
it reaches $100^{\circ}\,C$. Note that at this point, the system is still a liquid, but that any
heat addition will cause the liquid to vaporize(also known as saturated liquid).

Terms
[[saturation temperature]] $(T_\text{sat})$- designates the temperature at which vaporization
takes place at a given pressure, also known as the boiling temperature.
$$T \propto P$$
The reason why the phrase "at a given pressure" is that the boiling point 
or the saturation temperature is different for a given pressure. 

[[saturation pressure]] $(P_\text{sat})$ - designates the pressure at which a pure substance
changes phase at a given temperature

[[sub-cooled liquid]] - has a temperature lower than the saturation temperature
corresponding at a given pressure

[[compressed liquid]] - has a pressure higher than the saturation pressure at a 
given temperature

[[saturated liquid]] - a liquid that has a temperature equal to the boiling point at a
given pressure, it is $100\%$ liquid 

[[saturated vapor]] - a vapor that is about to [[condense]], $100\%$ vapor, neither has 
liquid nor moisture content

[[super-heated vapor]] - a vapor having a temperature higher than the saturation
temperature at a given pressure

Consider the figure above, representing the piston-cylinder at isobaric process,
from states $1$ to $2$, the fluid is still a compressed liquid since its temperature
is less than the boiling point temperature$(100^{\circ}\,C)$. And at state $2$ it is not a 
saturated liquid, further heat addition will lead to state $3$ and it is in a state
called saturated liquid-vapor mixture. Once at state $4$, the liquid is now ready to 
fully vaporize called [[saturated vapor]]. Any further heat addition no longer 
creates phase change, and is now a [[super-heated vapor]].
