If $(x_1 , y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ are are two points on a line, with $x_1 \ne x_2$, then the slope(m) 
of the line is expressed as $$ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$
Note that this can also be formulated as $$ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$
Or in a informal manner: $$ m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$$
