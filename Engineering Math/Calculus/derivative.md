I. Geometric interpretation of derivative
	Finding the tangent to the line $y = f(x)$ at point P($x_0\,,y_0$)
		Key ideas to remember:
			A. [[slope]]
			B. equation of the [[line]] 
			C. concept of a [[function]]
			D. [[tangent line]]
			E. [[secant line]]

The derivative $f'(x)$ of $f(x)$ at $x_0$, is the slope of the tangent line to $y = f(x)$ at 
$P$ or that the tangent line is the limit of secant lines.

The [[secant line]] is the average rate of change
