## What is axial stress?

stress due to axial force or force acting at the centroid of resisting cross-
sectional Area

---
- Tensile Stress ($S_T$) $$S_t = \frac{P}{A_t}$$ 
*But some books use the notation of $\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$  and uses $F$ and $P$ interchangeably*
tensile loads are often associated with $P$ and $F$.


- [[Compressive Stress]] ($S_c$ ) $$S_c = \frac{P}{A_c}$$
